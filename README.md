# Room-Occupancy-Detection
This project implements a machine learning model for detecting room occupancy based on environmental sensor data. The model uses features such as temperature, humidity, light, and CO2 levels to predict whether a room is occupied.

Features
Sensor-based occupancy prediction
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Machine learning model training and evaluation
Visualization of predictions and sensor data


Dataset
The dataset includes environmental sensor readings collected over time, with labels indicating room occupancy status. Key features include:
Temperature (Â°C)
Humidity (%)
Light (Lux)
CO2 (ppm)
Humidity Ratio
Occupancy (0 or 1)

Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are also provided for better insight into the model's performance.
